# Functional Programming in Lisp
## Farmer, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage Puzzle

A farmer with his wolf, goat, and cabbage arrive at the bank of a river. A boat 
at the riverâ€™s edge is only large enough for the farmer and one of his 
possessions. The farmer cannot leave the wolf alone with the goat, or the goat
alone with the cabbage. Write a program in Lisp to help the farmer cross the 
river with all of his possessions intact.

Initiate the search by typing (FWGC) at the Lisp prompt. Output each state in 
the solution path in a nicely-formatted sequence, similar to this:

  *>* (fwgc)

    Left Bank    Right Bank    Action
    ---------    ----------    ------------------------
    (F W G C)    -             *start state*
    (W C)        (F G)         farmer takes goat across
    (F W C)      (G)           farmer returns alone
    ...          ...           ...
    (F G)        (W C)         farmer returns alone
    -            (F W G C)     farmer takes goat across
                               *** problem solved! ***
This is a classic Artificial Intelligence (AI) problem. The high-level  symbolic 
approach to problem-solving in AI is known as the state space approach, and 
involves graph search. In this approach, successor states are generated from the 
start state. One or more of these successors are selected for exploration in the 
next iteration, new successors are generated, and eventually a path is 
determined from the start state to the goal state in the state space graph. A 
variety of search strategies have been developed to explore the state space in  
different ways. Exhaustive search strategies eventually explore all possible 
successor states en route to finding a solution path. 

Depth-first search (DFS) is an exhaustive search technique that is most easily 
described recursively:

    if ( current_state == goal_state )
        return SUCCESS;

    for each unexplored successor of the current state
        if ( DFS( successor ) == SUCCESS )
            return SUCCESS;

    return FAILURE;

DFS explores potential solution paths as deeply as possible, until it reaches a 
goal (success), or hits a dead end (no unexplored successor nodes) and must 
backtrack. Recursion is an elegant way to handle the backtracking. Once a goal 
state is reached, the path can be traced back to the start state to recover the 
sequence of solution steps.

### Notes:
 - Write a Lisp program that uses the state space approach to solve the Farmer, 
   Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Problem. Code a recursive DFS function to implement 
   the search strategy. 
   
 - Your code must be readable, modular, nicely formatted, and adequately 
   documented, as well as complete and correct. It must build and run 
   successfully under the current CLISP interpreter (version 2.49) under Windows
   and Linux. If your program does not run correctly, indicate why.
